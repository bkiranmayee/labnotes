These are my notes and commands for generating datasets for use in my talk at the 2019 ASDA Cattle Genetics symposia.

## Assessing relative genome resolution of different technologies

I want to draw comparative maps of the different technologies used to track genetic variants in the cattle genome. I intend this to visualize the progress that each method has had on the resulting assembly map and to show the differences in resolution that each method provides.

### Reduced representation sequencing for SNP50 (Van Tassel Nat. Methods)

Curt, Tad and company first used DraI (TTT^AAA) in an *in silico* digest of Btau3.1 but found that it did not perform as well *in vitro*. This may be due to their use of the incomplete assembly (Btau3.1 = 2.4 Gbp assembly size;
