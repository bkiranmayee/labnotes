These are my notes on the generation of SV, MEI and other variant calls on the buffalo sequence data compared to the cattle reference assembly.

## Setting the stage
I need to generate alignments and to start the data analysis. I plan on aligning to UMD3 because of the gene annotation present on that assembly. That will be critical in the identification of MEI and selective sweep variants that are present in the 5'UTR of genes.
