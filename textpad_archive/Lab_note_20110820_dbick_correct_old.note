# This note file contains my steps and procedures for correcting aCGH calls on the data.
# So, I'm actually at a little bit of a loss as to how to proceed here
# Here are my thoughts:
	1. Get the older CNVs from the korean and danish papers
	2. Get the WSSD predictions and WGAC
	3. Find locations where my data intersects with the intervals, and redefine the boundaries
	
# This might be a waste of time.
# I am going to focus on the figures and tables and return here only if I need to.
