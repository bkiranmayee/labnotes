# So I need to test my pipeline out on human data to ensure that I have good stringent criteria for CNV detection.
# George and I have come to the conclusion that NA18506 (the YRI daughter) is a good test, since SV merge used it as its test state as well
# I need to download the YRI data from the SRA and run my pipeline on the reads

# I downloaded the GRCH7 assembly and repeatmasker output from the GR website

# Now, to prepare the assembly, I just need to mask the gaps with "X's" and hardmask the chromosome files with "N's" from the repeatmasker output

# I need to download the NA18506 reads on the lewis cluster.
