# These are my notes on running penncnv for Tad using the jersey animals that Matt and Heather gave me

# I obtained the raw data from Heather and downloaded it to my hard drive. Location is here:
	pwd: /home/dbickhart/share/tad_jersey/Jersey_081623012
	
# I next loaded it into genome studio by clicking the ".bsc" file
# finally, I clicked the Analysis->Cluster option in the genomestudio file menu, since Heather and Matt had not clustered the snps for genotypes

# Ah, I found out the problem: I need the idat files to call the genotypes.
